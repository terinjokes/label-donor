# Label Donor

> Donor of frequently used GitHub labels.

When triaging issues on GitHub repositories, I frequently find myself desiring for labels I've used on other projects.
This repository is a "donor", and labels are copied from it using Jurgen Van de Moere's [Copy GitHub Label CLI](https://github.com/jvandemo/copy-github-labels-cli) tool.
